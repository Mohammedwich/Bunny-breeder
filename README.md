# Bunny-breeder

--At program initialization 5 bunnies are created and given random colors.

--Each turn afterwards the bunnies age 1 year.

--So long as there is at least one male age 2 or older, for each female bunny in the list age 2 or older;
  a new bunny is created each turn. (i.e. if there was 1 adult male and 3 adult female bunnies, three new bunnies would be born each turn)

--New bunnies born are the same color as their mother.

--If a bunny becomes older than 10 years old, it dies.

--If a radioactive mutant vampire bunny is born then each turn it will change one non radioactive bunny into a radioactive vampire bunny.
  (if there are two radioactive mutant vampire bunnies two bunnies will be changed each turn and so on...)

--Radioactive vampire bunnies are excluded from regular breeding and do not count as adult bunnies.

--Radioactive vampire bunnies do not die until they reach age 50.

--The program will print a list of all the bunnies in the colony each turn along with all the bunnies details.

--The program should also output each turn's events such as bunnies being born, bunnies dying, and bunnies infected

--If Total bunnies become greater than 100 the population becomes over crowded and half of them die to a food shortage
